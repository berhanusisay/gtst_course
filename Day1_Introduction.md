# Introduction to Ethical Hacking
## What is hacking?
- Hacking is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities
and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized 
access to the system.
-  Ethical hacking finds the weak points or loopholes in a 
computer, web application, or network and reports them 
to the organization
- The person who do the hacking is called “HACKER”

#  Types of hackers based on Ethics
## BLACK HAT hackers
- The most evil and bad Peoples
## White HAT hackers
-  The helping and Good Peoples
## Grey HAT hackers
- The middle mans ,Good sometimes bad thinking 
Peoples

# Types of hackers based on Skill
## Newbie / Noob
- Don’t have any knowledge about hacking
## Script Kiddie
- A script kiddie, skiddie, kiddie, or skid is a relatively 
unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, 
primarily for malicious purposes
## Hacker
- Perfectly skilled, with less experience
## Elite/Pro Hacker
- Perfectly skilled, with Much more experience

# Why do we learn hacking??
1. To prevent hackers from gaining access
2. To uncover vulnerabilities
3. To strengthen the organization
4. To safeguard the data
5. To avoid security Breaches
6. To enhance security awareness

# Who can be an Ethical Hacker??

- Programming
- Networking
- Linux
- System admin
# Phases of Hacking
1. Reconnaissance
2. Scanning

4. Maintaining Access
5. Clearing Tracks or Logs
# Penetration Testing
- Penetration Testing is a method of evaluating 
the security of an information system or 
network by simulating an attack to
- find vulnerability
- Security Measures
- Documentation and Report Preparation

# Why we need Penetration Testing?
- Identification of threats
